# Gemma Skills for AI Edge Gallery

This repository contains production-ready skills for Gemma 4 in Google AI Edge Gallery.

The goal is simple: give on-device mobile LLMs practical capabilities through reusable skill packages that are easy to install, test, and extend.

## What This Project Provides

- Curated skills for real-world use cases such as legal guidance, coaching, recommendations, and web-grounded search
- Support for both skill types used by AI Edge Gallery:
	- Text-based skills (SKILL.md only)
	- JavaScript skills (SKILL.md plus scripts/index.html running in a sandboxed hidden webview)
- A structure that is easy to contribute to and review

## Skill Format

Each skill lives in its own folder and follows one of these patterns:

1. Text-based skill
	 - SKILL.md

2. JavaScript skill
	 - SKILL.md
	 - scripts/index.html
	 - Optional assets/ for webviews and UI files

## Getting Started

1. Pick a skill folder under skills/.
2. Review its SKILL.md and README.md.
3. Import SKILL.md into Google AI Edge Gallery using URL or local file.
4. If required, provide a secret key when the app prompts for it.

For implementation details and full skill architecture, see SKILL-GUIDE.md.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome for new skills and improvements to existing ones.

Recommended workflow:

1. Create a new folder under skills/ using kebab-case.
2. Add SKILL.md with clear metadata and activation description.
3. For JS skills, add scripts/index.html and keep logic sandbox-safe.
4. Add a README.md with overview, installation, and usage examples.
5. Validate behavior in AI Edge Gallery before opening a PR.

## Design Principles

- Keep skills useful and domain-specific
- Prefer text-only skills unless JavaScript adds clear value
- Keep JavaScript lightweight and webview-safe
- Avoid hardcoding secrets
- Return structured outputs and clear errors
